# **Happy Hour**

## **Overview**
The purpose of this project was to create an application that would allow a user to select from 14 different cocktails (e.g., Paloma, Midnight Cowboy, etc.). This would then display each cocktail name, an image of the cocktail, the recipe for the cocktail, and a button feature to allow the user to translate how to order the cocktail in the native language of the cocktail's country of origin.  

### **User Story**
AS A cocktail enthusiast who loves to travel<br>
I WANT to be able to order a signature cocktail in the native language from the region that  I'm visiting<br>
SO THAT I can better experience & enjoy the culture of the region

### **Acceptance Criteria**
Application uses at least two server-side APIs.<br>
Application uses client-side storage to store persistent data.<br>
Application doesn't use JS alerts, prompts, or confirms (uses modals instead).<br>
Application uses a CSS framework other than Bootstrap.<br>
Application is interactive (accepts and responds to user input)<br>
